     * Variables defined in the class that store data related to that Class.
     * Example: A "Person" class might have an attribute called "String name"

     * class Cat extends Animal {}

     * Animal animal = new Dog(...)
     *
     * if Dog overrides any of Animal's methods, despite being typed as an Animal
     * it will use the Dog's overwritten version
